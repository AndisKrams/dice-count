# Dice count

This is a calculation game, displaying randomly generated dice and asking users to count dice of a certain colour.
Website is deployed here: <https://andiskrams.github.io/dice-count/>

## Rationale

I created a dice rolling game for users who want to practice the skill of quick dice counting under changing circumstances. To make the game more engaging and challenging there are 7 different colours of dice, but users are asked to count only dice of one randomly chosen colour. To require extra attention from players, the name of the specified colour in the question is coloured, but not necessarily in the same colour as the word states.

The game has an easily overseeable layout with a dice display area in the middle, between the question and the answer input area. On a page load there are short instructions for new users, explaining the features of the game.

For player convenience the game has 2 event listeners for main interactions, allowing users to freely switch between clicking in the game area or using the keyboard.

For the site's owner, wishing to further develop the game with additional features, code has comments explaining functionality to make future development easier. There are no purely decorative elements or images, allowing to add new features without disrupting style consistency.
