# Dice count

This is a calculation game, displaying randomly generated dice and asking users to count dice of a certain colour.
Website is deployed here: <https://andiskrams.github.io/dice-count/>

## Rationale

I created a dice rolling game for users who want to practice the skill of quick dice counting under changing circumstances. To make the game more engaging and challenging there are 7 different colours of dice, but users are asked to count only dice of one randomly chosen colour. To require extra attention from players, the name of the specified colour in the question is coloured, but not necessarily in the same colour as the word states.

The game has an easily overseeable layout with a dice display area in the middle, between the question and the answer input area. On a page load there are short instructions for new users, explaining the features of the game.

For player convenience the game has 2 event listeners for main interactions, allowing users to freely switch between clicking in the game area or using the keyboard.

For the site's owner, wishing to further develop the game with additional features, code has comments explaining functionality to make future development easier. Dice display is made with HTML and CSS code, allowing easy customisation of the colours. There are no purely decorative elements or images, allowing to add new features without disrupting style consistency.

### Potential features left to implement

## Development

After creating a rough html layout with the placeholders for the game features I started to implement JavaScript code to generate random values and display them as dice. First I used the images of dice, but realising limitations of a preset colours for the further development I changed code to use CSS and HTML for displaying dice elements. The resulting code on each dice roll generates a few random variables, displays dice of various colours and a question for the user to complete calculation.

The next step was to create code for checking users' answers and displaying feedback. Performing manual tests I noticed that the player's score becomes incorrect after a couple of rounds. I checked the syntax with linter and used console.log messages to see the values of variables. Tests showed previously generated dice values to be compared against users input from the last answer. To figure out how to stop values generated previously appearing in the function checking users' answers was a major hurdle in the development of this project.

To solve this issue I tried to restructure the code by moving the nested function checkAnswer() outside and resetting variables after use. In the process of fixing the code I was able to spot and solve some issues slowing the execution, but the main issue with repeated occurrence of values persisted. Eventually, in a training session, I got an indication about the problems with event listeners and in which part of the code to turn them off.

Adding the function that sets off both event listeners for input solved the issue with recurring values, but this prevented repeated input in case of empty or invalid input. To deal with it I restructured the code so that the function to validate input is called before the answer is checked and event listeners are set off.

After testing JavaScript code I did styling and cleaning of the code.

## Design choices



## Technologies used

* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery.
* Visual Studio Code as an IDE. I used some Copilot suggestions and Code review.

## Testing

While automatic testing is significantly faster and more accurate, I didnâ€™t use any test code for this relatively simple application which doesn't have many scenarios of events. Manual testing is more flexible and allows to take in account users' experience.

At the start of the project I relied on console error messages to spot bugs. First one was: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined. That was caused by jquery link in index.html being located after script.js.

During the development process I continued to look for reference errors in the console after implementing changes. There were few instances of not defined variables. To solve them I checked spellings of variable names and looked at the scope of functions.

Implementation of the checkAnswer function started to give wrong feedback on manual functionality tests and the console started to show forced reflow violation, indicating that code of the game starts to slow down after repeated rolls. Logging variables in different locations of the code showed repetition of variables generated in previous dice rolls. The reason for this occurrence was unclosed event listeners. Finally adding closures of two event listeners after each of them resolved this issue.
